## Risk Modeling Suite

Balances classical risk measurement (Conditional VaR) with modern volatility modeling techniques (GARCH family) to provide robust risk assessment across market conditions. 

A carefully selected combination of statistical models for volatility and risk analysis:

### Model Selection Rationale
- **Conditional VaR (Expected Shortfall)**: 
  - Provides straightforward tail risk estimation
  - Represents classical risk measurement approach
- **GARCH Family Models**:
  - Comprehensive volatility modeling toolkit
  - Includes modern variations:
    - Standard GARCH
    - EGARCH (Exponential GARCH)
    - GJR-GARCH (Glosten-Jagannathan-Runkle)

### Implementation Features
- **Conditional VaR**:
  - Simple, interpretable risk metric
  - Focuses on extreme loss quantification
- **GARCH Variants**:
  - Captures different volatility characteristics:
    - EGARCH: Asymmetric volatility responses
    - GJR-GARCH: Leverage effects
    - Standard GARCH: Basic volatility clustering
