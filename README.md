## Embedded LLM Integration

This system incorporates the **Wizard-Math** LLM model with automated management:

### Implementation Overview
- **Model**: Wizard-Math (specialized for mathematical reasoning)
- **Management Script**: Python-based control system that:
  - Verifies model installation
  - Automatically installs missing dependencies
  - Monitors server status
  - Manages Ollama service lifecycle

### Operational Flow
1. **Installation Check**: Validates Wizard-Math presence in the local environment
2. **Auto-Installation**: Handles missing model installation via Ollama
3. **Service Management**: Ensures Ollama server is running
4. **Terminal Execution**: Runs Wizard-Math in interactive terminal mode

### Usage Notes
- First execution may take longer due to model download
- Requires stable internet connection for initial setup
- Runs natively in terminal environment
