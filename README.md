#Debian OS turned into a cli for quantitative finance 

The point of this project was to manipulate and play around a bit with basic statistical models to more advanced one. But also play around with os development and modification. The idea was to create a comprehensive 
and complete tool which could be used by quantiative financial analysts or traders. The tool would be completly separated and work on its own as an iso file. So like an OS, its not just another tab you have on the
chrome browser.
