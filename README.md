Making a small os for quantitative finance 

The point of this project was to mess around with some statistical models , iso files , and interacting with llm. Honestly speaking this file cannot do much besides some basic stuff but i feel like its pretty cool already. 
Maybe when i'll have more time i'll modify it and add more powerful stuff , also the generative models do not produce the best outputs right now but as a starter its pretty decent , and they will only get better from now. 

This project happened in bascially 2 :  
1. Build the codes in conda
2. make the environement executable as a standalone program
3. convert it into an os
