pretty basic and simple risk prediction and modelling programs , i chose garch and conditional var bcs i feel like this is a good mix between classic statistical models and more modern ones ( if you could call conditional var classic and garch modern) 

the conditional var is pretty straightforwad 
the garch however is really complete with all the variations ( garch , egarch , gjr-garch)
